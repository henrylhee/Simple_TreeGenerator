The Simple Tree Generator is a small project with whom you can generate trees in Unity.
They can be generated in the editor or at runtime.
## Graph Generation
The first part of the tree generation is the growth of a graph. A graph is a set of nodes. Each node has a length, a direction and a thickness. 
According to tweakable options and randomness a new node grows from the end of the last node. There is also a chance for a split, creating a new branch.
